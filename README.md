# Prompster-CLI

**Your AI agent for custom Hitster card decks.**

Prompster is a conversational AI agent that builds Hitster card decks with you — 
not for you. Describe a vibe, an era, a genre, or just a feeling. The agent asks 
follow-up questions, searches Spotify, digs through discographies and curated 
playlists, and iterates with you until the deck is exactly right. Then it generates 
the print-ready PDF.

## What the cards look like

  <img src="static/page_back.png" width="380" alt="Back side — song, artist and year">
</p>

**Front:** QR code → Spotify link.  
**Back:** Artist, title, year.

## Installation

> Requires [Python 3.14+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dein-user/hitster-cli.git

```

### Spotify setup

Prompster needs access to the Spotify API to search for songs and create playlists.

1. Create an app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Set the redirect URI to: `http://localhost:8888/callback`
3. Create a `.env` file in the project folder:
```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
```

## Usage
```bash
prompster
```

Just describe what kind of deck you want — Prompster takes care of the rest.

### How it works

Prompster is an AI agent that guides you through two phases:

**Phase 1 — Build the playlist**

1. Chat about your theme, vibe, era, and favorite artists. Prompster asks follow-up questions before touching Spotify.
2. The agent does thorough research: it searches tracks, digs into albums, checks artist discographies, and browses existing curated playlists — not just the first 10 results.
3. You choose how many cards you want (15 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50).
4. Prompster creates a Spotify playlist and shares the link so you can listen.
5. Iterate freely — remove tracks, swap songs, or start over until the playlist is exactly right.

**Phase 2 — Generate cards**

Once you're happy with the playlist, say the word. Prompster generates the print-ready PDF.
